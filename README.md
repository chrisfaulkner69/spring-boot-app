# Spring Boot 3 Fundamentals

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is a place to consolidate config, examples, test case samples, etc for Spring and in particular Spring Boot.

### Running it

There are MongoDB and postgres services in docker-compose. 

    docker compose up -d

To start the spring boot application 


    mvn spring-boot:run

It's a maven project obviously so the rest of it should just follow that standard.

CircleCI integration for pipelines 

Dependabot (via GitHub) for automated dependency management
